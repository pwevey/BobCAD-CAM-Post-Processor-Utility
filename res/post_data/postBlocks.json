Using this mode will trigger the posting engine to output rotary direction codes when they are encountered on a postline.

Indexing will not output inverse time feedrates. Multiaxis paths where continuous rotation is present will be output with Inverse Time Feedrates, but multiaxis where rotary positioning is not done during the feeding cut will be output without Inverse Time Feedrates.
